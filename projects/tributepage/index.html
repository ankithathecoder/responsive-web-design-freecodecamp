      <p>
        Dr. Norman Borlaug was an American agronomist and humanitarian who
        is often called "the father of the Green Revolution." His work in
        developing high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties saved
        millions from starvation and earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.
      </p>
      <p>
        His innovations and dedication significantly contributed to
        increased agricultural productivity worldwide and helped prevent
        famines in many developing countries.
