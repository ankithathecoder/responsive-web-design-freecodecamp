|-----------|----------------|
| **Tribute Page** | A clean webpage to honor a historical figure with semantic HTML |
| **Survey Form** | A user input form built using form elements and responsive styling |
| **Product Landing Page** | A landing page for a fictional product with images, nav, and layout |
| **Technical Documentation** | A documentation page featuring a sidebar and code sections |
| **Personal Portfolio** | A responsive portfolio site to showcase these projects |

You can find the source code for each project in its respective folder.
